To view a copy of this license, visit https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/ Overview FTPChat is a lightweight, encrypted messaging protocol implemented entirely in Python. It facilitates secure communication by reading and writing messages to a shared file hosted on an FTP server. FTPChat is specifically designed for deployment in legacy environments, including low-power routers equipped with USB and FTP capabilities. This makes it an ideal solution for resource-constrained scenarios or discreet operations. Key Features (v1.4) 24-layer encryption ensuring robust payload security File-based transport mechanism utilizing FTP/FTPS fallback Single .py file deployment for simplicity Optimized for legacy hardware and low-power devices International chatting via SFTPCloud Tool Local LAN support with Documentation/Quick Start Guide (Making FTP Server).md Threaded send/receive \u2014 no UI freezing during FTP operations Auto-refresh loop with restart-safe scheduling Modern UI with ttkbootstrap (dark theme, styled buttons) Blue primary buttons for clarity and aesthetics Non-editable chat history with scrollable view Modular encryption pipeline (easy to extend with new ciphers) New Features Added in v1.4 Threaded FTP I/O: Both sending and reading run in background threads for smooth, non-blocking UI Improved Error Handling: Clear fallbacks between FTP_TLS and FTP, with user-friendly error messages Styled UI Elements: Buttons themed with ttkbootstrap\u2019s primary style for a modern look Auto-Scroll Chat Window: Messages always scroll to the latest entry Help Menu Integration: Direct link to project documentation and exit option Restart-Safe Loop Control: Auto-refresh loop can be started once and remains stable Encryption Pipeline Refactor: Doubled 12-layer MAC encryption plus compression for symbolic resilience Protocol Operation Messages are exchanged via a shared file on an FTP server. Each message contains a timestamp, username, and encrypted content. The protocol provides: - Conflict-safe message writing - Encrypted message formatting - Lightweight, file-based communication Usage Instructions Download FtpChat.exe for Windows 10/11, or run the Python script on macOS/Linux. Activate your FTP server. Refer to Documentation/Quick Start Guide (Making FTP Server).md . Enter your credentials as prompted. Review the Notes Before Starting section prior to use.
