### FTPChat

### Overview

FTPChat is a lightweight, encrypted messaging protocol implemented entirely in Python.  
It facilitates secure communication by reading and writing messages to a shared file hosted on an FTP server.

FTPChat is specifically designed for deployment in legacy environments, including low-power routers equipped with USB and FTP capabilities. This makes it an ideal solution for resource-constrained scenarios or discreet operations.

### Key Features

- 24-layer encryption ensuring robust payload security
- File-based transport mechanism utilizing FTP
- Fully operational within a single `.py` file
- Optimized for legacy hardware and low-power devices
- Compatible with routers supporting USB and FTP
- Energy-efficient and environmentally conscious design

### Protocol Operation

Messages are exchanged via a shared file on an FTP server.  
Each message contains a timestamp, username, and encrypted content.  
The protocol provides:

- Conflict-safe message writing
- Encrypted message formatting
- Lightweight, file-based communication

**Note:** FTPChat does not support auto-refresh or background polling.

### Usage Instructions

1. Download `FtpChat.exe` for Windows, or run the Python script on macOS or Linux.
2. Activate your FTP server. Refer to `Documentation/Quick Start Guide (Making FTP Server).md` for detailed setup instructions.
3. Enter your credentials as prompted.
