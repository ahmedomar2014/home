### **FTPChat (File Transfer Chatting Project)**

#### **Overview:**

FTPChat is a lightweight, encrypted messaging protocol implemented entirely in Python.  
It facilitates secure communication by reading and writing messages to a shared file hosted on an FTP server.

FTPChat is specifically designed for deployment in legacy environments, including low-power routers equipped with USB and FTP capabilities. This makes it an ideal solution for resource-constrained scenarios or discreet operations.

#### **Key Features:**

- 24-layer encryption ensuring robust payload security
- File-based transport mechanism utilizing FTP
- Fully operational within a single `.py` file
- Optimized for legacy hardware and low-power devices
- Compatible with routers supporting USB and FTP
- Energy-efficient and environmentally conscious design
- You can also chat internationally (Non LAN) by using [SFTPCloud Tool](https://sftpcloud.io/tools/free-ftp-server) a free tool that you can make a globally accessible FTP server
- You can also make it work locally by using our guide `Documentation/Quick Start Guide (Making FTP Server).md`

#### **Protocol Operation:**

Messages are exchanged via a shared file on an FTP server.  
Each message contains a timestamp, username, and encrypted content.  
The protocol provides:

- Conflict-safe message writing
- Encrypted message formatting
- Lightweight, file-based communication

**Note:** FTPChat does not support auto-refresh or background polling.

#### **Usage Instructions:**

1. Download `FtpChat.exe` for Windows 10/11, or run the Python script on macOS or Linux.
2. Activate your FTP server. Refer to `Documentation/Quick Start Guide (Making FTP Server).md` for detailed setup instructions.
3. Enter your credentials as prompted.
4. Please review the `Notes Before Starting` section prior to use.

#### **Usage Instructions:**

**üîê To Encrypt Files**:

1. Run `Tlock.exe` on Windows.
2. Choose the file type you wish to encrypt.
3. A key will be generated and auto-copied for later access for the file.
4. The encrypted file will be saved with a `.te*` extension.

**üîì To Decrypt Files**:

1. Run `Tlock.exe` on Windows.
2. Choose the file type you wish to decrypt.
3. Enter the decryption key that was auto-copied.
4. The decrypted file will be restored to its original format (e.g., `.txt`, `.jpg`, `.mp3`, `.docx`, etc.).
5. You can view or play the decrypted content immediately after recovery.

**üîê To Encrypt Text Files**:

1. Run `Tlock.exe` on Windows.
2. Navigate to the **Text Files** menu and select **Save a Tetf**.
3. Type or paste your text into the input field.
4. Enter a password when prompted.
5. Save the encrypted file when prompted. It will be saved with a `.tetf` extension.

**üîì To Decrypt Text Files**:

1. Run `Tlock.exe` on Windows.
2. Navigate to the **Text Files** menu and select **Open a Tetf**.
3. Choose the `.tetf` file you wish to decrypt.
4. Enter the correct password when prompted.
5. The decrypted content will be displayed in a new window.
6. You can optionally activate **Text to Speech** to read the content aloud, but it needs network connection.

#### **Performance Benchmark:**

- Encrypted approximately 100,000 characters under full 48-layer mode
- Tested on:

  - **Intel Core i5-13420H**, RTX 2050 GPU, 16GB RAM DDR5

    - Result: ~30 seconds

  - **Intel Core i7-8650U**, Intel UHD 620, 16GB RAM DDR3
    - Result: ~1 minute 30 seconds

- Environment: Windows 11, Python 3.13
- Result: The program performs faster on higher-end CPUs
- Note: Less size = Faster speeds and vice versa
